## Back end Prerequisites

You will need to have Node.js and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

## Back end Installation

Clone this repository. From the "back" folder of the project, run the following command to install dependencies:
`npm install`

You can then run the server with:
`node server`

The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g., `Listening on port 3001`.
